          <p>
            I'm a software developer based in Leyland, Lancashire, working for a
            FTSE100 company in the automotive industry. I predominately work on
            backend systems using Java, with a sprinkle of Angular frontend work
            for internal tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my past life I was a digital marketing professional, and after
            two years of self-development I transitioned into a career in
            software development. I'm sharing my thoughts, journey and what I'm
            learning here. Thanks for stopping by.
