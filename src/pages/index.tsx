          <p>
            I'm a software developer based in Manchester, UK, working for a FTSE
            100 company in the automotive industry. I predominately work on
            backend systems using Java, with a sprinkle of Angular frontend work
            for internal tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also had exposure to tools such as DBT, Airflow and BigQuery
            whilst developing data products for internal customer use.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my past life I was a digital marketing professional, and after
            two years of self-learning I transitioned into a career in software
            development. I'm sharing my development thoughts and what I'm
            learning here.
          </p>
          <p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
